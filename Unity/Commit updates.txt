Nov 26:
- Added a GUI to make error calculations easier
- Fixed the values of orbit_info.txt, so it's all in km and has more digits
* BUG: The moons, starting from 625, move without being told to

Nov 21:
- A ship orbits earth at an altitude of 30,000 km

Nov 19:
- Updated the text files to include 142 moons 
- Fixed the moving moons bug
- Commented the scripts
- Removed unnecessary scripts (prefab_move and trackMove)
- Camera doesn't work with the new instantiated moons
- There's a button to add a spaceship from a previous version
- Folder has been created to organize languages
- Pluto is in the main planets under the Bary Center

Nov 2:
- Different structuring of the scripts
- Each planet has a script that stores the variables
- There's a central script that controls the movement
- Using script to initiate 30 other moons
* The new scripts have not been commented yet
* Some of the moons move without being told to

Oct 19:
- The bug in trackMove has been fixed (the sun was causing an infinite loop)
- trackMoves.cs was removed from the sun
- An orbit of a planet was created. The planet's ID is to be put into the code by hand.

Oct 9:
- Deleted scripts that are not used anymore
- Commented scripts
- The game freezes if the planets are kept running for long
	* There might be a problem with the calculations, causing everything to freeze

Oct 2:
- Integrated trackMove.cs into the system
- This calculates the position of the planets rather than read from a file
- It considerably lags.... :(

Sept 25:
- Pop-up windows for planets with information about them
- Can open, close and drag windows for different planets
- Hid the older button for information (the code for it is till there)

Sept 18:
- Change the planes of planets rotation (x-z plane now)
- Set the camera so it rotates horizontally and vertically around planets (bug around the sun)

Sept 11:
- Increase range of sun light
- Camera is facing the light 
- Can change camera by button click or pressing Enter
- Adding preliminary text boxes for planets

Sep 05:
- Fixed the location and rotation of BaryCenter
- Multiply radius by 2, cuz Unity's scale is diameter
- Provide a fail-safe for BaryCenter location
- Camera follows planets around

Aug 31:
- Removed cameras for each body, make it one camera
- Pause works
- Realized a problem with the position of bodies
- Organized the project folders
- Attemped jumping camera

Aug 24:
- Have the planets moving
- Cameras for every planet
